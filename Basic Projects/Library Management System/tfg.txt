Event: World Space Week 2024

Good [morning/afternoon] everyone, my name is [your name], and today we are thrilled to present our project,
Zero Bank Gravity. This experiment is part of an exciting initiative that bridges space exploration and climate
science. We aim to explore how phytoplankton, tiny marine organisms that play a crucial role in carbon cycling,
respond to space conditions. Our focus is primarily on understanding how microgravity affects these organisms
and what that might mean for the future of climate science.

[Slide 2]
Introduction:
Phytoplankton are essential to life on Earth as they absorb a large portion of the CO2 in the atmosphere,
regulating our climate through a process known as carbon sequestration. However, one question remains:
how do these organisms behave in the challenging environment of space, specifically under microgravity?
This is a largely unexplored area of research, and understanding it could help improve both climate models
and our broader understanding of carbon sequestration on Earth. Our experiment seeks to uncover how space
conditions like microgravity influence the growth and carbon absorption abilities of these critical organisms.

[Slide 3]
Objectives:
The core of our research revolves around two major objectives:
    Microgravity's Effect: We will investigate how microgravity influences the growth, distribution, and
    overall health of phytoplankton.
    Carbon Absorption in Space: We will also look at how varying levels of CO2 in space affect the organisms'
    ability to absorb carbon and sequester it.
This data could help us develop new insights into how carbon sequestration processes might operate in space
and, in turn, enhance our understanding of these processes on Earth.

Experiment Design:
For this experiment, we will cultivate phytoplankton in sealed growth chambers aboard the International Space
Station (ISS). These chambers will simulate ocean conditions such as nutrient levels, light exposure, and
CO2 levels. Using sensors, we will continuously monitor key parameters like the growth rate of the phytoplankton,
their nutrient uptake, and how efficiently they absorb carbon. To get the most comprehensive results, we will
compare the behavior of phytoplankton grown in space with control samples on Earth. By doing this, we hope to
uncover the specific ways in which microgravity affects their efficiency and adaptability.

Analyzing Ocean Carbon Sequestration:
The ISS offers a unique vantage point, not just for our experiment, but for Earth-based observations as well.
Through satellite imagery and sensors, we will also monitor phytoplankton blooms in Earth’s oceans. By
combining data from our experiment with these space-based observations, we can refine our estimates of
how much carbon the oceans are capable of sequestering. This will enable more accurate predictions about
the future role of oceans in climate change mitigation.

Additionally, by studying the interplay between phytoplankton in space and their Earth counterparts, we can
develop more sophisticated climate models that are better at predicting global warming scenarios and
oceanic carbon absorption rates.

[Slide 6]
Expected Outcomes:
We anticipate that our research will lead to several important outcomes:

    First, we expect to gain insights into how microgravity affects the growth, behavior, and carbon sequestration
    capacity of phytoplankton.
    Second, by understanding how CO2 variations impact these organisms in space, we can enhance predictions
    for how they might function under different climate scenarios here on Earth.
    Lastly, this data could lead to more accurate global climate models that incorporate both Earth-based and
    space-based data for a holistic view of carbon sequestration processes.

Our experiment could open doors to further research on space-based carbon removal technologies, which might
prove vital in mitigating the effects of climate change.

[Slide 7]
Conclusion:
In conclusion, our experiment, Zero Bank Gravity, is a stepping stone in the field of space and climate research.
By studying phytoplankton behavior under microgravity, we will gain valuable data that will help us understand
how these organisms contribute to climate regulation, both in space and on Earth. With this knowledge, we can
better refine global climate strategies and develop new technologies aimed at reducing atmospheric carbon
levels.

The data we collect will also help improve satellite-based climate monitoring systems, giving scientists and
policymakers real-time accurate data for better-informed decisions. As we venture further into space, such
research will help ensure we have the tools needed to protect our planet for generations to come.

Thank you for your attention. I’d now like to open the floor for any questions.
